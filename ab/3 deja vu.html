<p> Perhaps this makes some sense, but I disagree with such version. Deja vu is nothing else than a reference to your past life. There are so-called time loops. And at some stages of life,
 we can fall into such loops. Just when a certain moment of our life is repeated, some actions are postponed in the human consciousness, 
resulting in a feeling of deja vu. Have you experienced anything like this? </p>

<p>Have you ever seen something completely inexplicable, and then just said, “Oh, no, it seemed to me”. People consider alcohol, drugs and other substances that make the psyche of 
people more vulnerable the reasons for their visions. But what do you think about it? Send us your story.</p>
