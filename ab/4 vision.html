<p> Do you know anything about cases when people meet their doppelgangers? Some people have seen their doppelgangers, who accurately repeated all their actions, 
but the point is these people never had doubles.  They could not see them for the reason that they did not exist. The scientific version is that our nervous system is able
to create a spatial scheme of the body, which can manifest our consciousness as a real image. But ... in the world there is not only our dimension. And although there are not 
so many scientific facts proving it, such doppelgangers can occur because at some moments the line between measurements becomes vulnerable for unknown reasons, and a person without 
being aware of it can travel between measurements and during time meets his "ghostly" doppelgangers. </p>

<p>Our brain is really the most interesting object to study. You yourself are able to decide what is reality for you and what is fiction. 
This is only your life, be brave to go beyond the limits of reality to discover the world in a new way. </p>
