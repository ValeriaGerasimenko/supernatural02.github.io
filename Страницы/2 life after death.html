<p> A scientist from the California Institute of Technology has put forward his idea,
that life after death does not exist. However there are enough facts that completely deny it. 
Life after death is REALITY! Here are the facts:</p>
<UL>
<LI> Jeremy Bryan from the state of South Carolina wrote how during clinical death he had encountered with God. Christine Cooper, a resident of the state of Nevada, saw herself from above, being between worlds. </LI>
<LI> Our brain continues to work after death after our heart stop beating. This happens because it is not possible to instantly stop all processes in the human organism.  </LI>
<LI> Our spirit and body can exist separately from each other. Thus, William James, Japanese scientist, was holding seances for about 10 years, with which he proved the existence of an afterlife. </LI>

<p>Do you believe in afterlife?</p>
